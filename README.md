# Flame Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Flame Sensor project utilizes an Arduino Mega along with a flame sensor module to detect the presence of a flame. The flame sensor outputs a digital signal that indicates whether a flame is detected or not. This project will demonstrate how to interface the flame sensor with the Arduino Mega, read its digital output, and display the detection status on the Serial Monitor of Arduino IDE.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Flame Sensor Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Flame Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal (Digital Output)** to **Digital Pin 2**
   - **VCC** to **5V**
   - **GND** to **GND**

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - No additional libraries are required for this project.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the flame sensor module to the Arduino Mega as specified in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE to view flame detection status.

#### Applications

- **Fire Detection:** Use in fire alarm systems for early fire detection.
- **Safety Monitoring:** Monitor gas stoves, heaters, or any flame-based appliances.
- **Industrial Automation:** Integrate into systems where flame detection is critical for safety.
- **Robotics:** Implement flame detection for autonomous robots.

#### Notes

- Ensure the flame sensor is positioned to detect flames effectively within its specified range.
- Test and calibrate the sensor to ensure reliable detection of flames.
- Implement additional safety protocols based on flame detection outputs as per application requirements.
